"Basilisk C" is the extension of the C programming language used to
write code in Basilisk. The goal of this extension is to provide a
simple set of extra C-like constructs useful for writing
discretisation schemes on Cartesian grids.

[Part I](Basilisk C#part-i-basic-concepts) covers the basic concepts
which are necessary to setup simple simulations using [pre-defined
solvers](/src/README#solvers).

[Part II](Basilisk C#part-ii-more-advanced-concepts) gives further
details and is necessary if you want to setup more complex simulations
and/or write your own discretisation schemes.

The description of the language below assumes a basic knowledge of C
(e.g. the first four chapters of [*The C programming
language*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language)).

# Part I: Basic concepts

## Domain geometry

By default the computational domain is a (2D) square box of unit size
with the origin at `(0,0)` in the lower-left corner. This can be changed using
e.g.

~~~literatec
size (2.5);
origin (-1.2, -3.);
~~~

Changing from 2D (the default) to 1D or 3D can be done by [changing
grids](#one-two-or-three-dimensions). Non-squares (or non-cubic
in 3D) domains can be defined using the
[dimensions()](/src/Tips#non-cubic-domains) function.

The default number of grid points in each dimension is 64 in one or
two dimensions and 16 in 3D. It can be changed either using
[init_grid()](#grid-allocation-and-deallocation) or by setting the
value of the global variable `N`.

## Fields and stencils

*Field* constructs are used to store quantities discretised
spatially. They can be seen as a generalisation of C arrays. Three
types of fields can be defined: `scalar`, `vector` and `tensor`.

### Declaration, allocation and deallocation

A new field is declared as an [automatic
variable](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_variable) like this:

~~~literatec
scalar a[];
~~~

Alternatively, explicit allocation and deallocation can be done like this:

~~~literatec
scalar a = new scalar;
...
delete ({a});
~~~

where `{a}` is a [list](#lists) (with a single element in this example).

### Iterators

Field values are manipulated using *iterators*, for example:

~~~literatec
foreach()
  a[] = 1.;
~~~

where `foreach()` iterates over all the *stencils* defining the
discretised field.

Iterators also define several variables (implicitly) such as:

~~~literatec
double x, y, z; // coordinates of the center of the stencil
double Delta;   // size of the stencil cell
~~~

### Stencils

Stencils are used to access field values and their local neighbours. By
default Basilisk guarantees consistent field values in a 3x3
neighbourhood (in 2D). This can be represented like this

![3x3 stencil](/wiki/src//stencil.svg)

Neighbouring values are accessed using the indexing scheme pictured on
the figure. For example, computing an approximation of the Laplacian

$$b=\nabla^2 a$$

could be written

~~~literatec
scalar a[], b[];
...
foreach()
  b[] = (a[1,0] + a[0,1] + a[-1,0] + a[0,-1] - 4.*a[])/sq(Delta);
~~~

where `a[]` is a shortcut for `a[0,0]`.

### Vectors and tensors

Vector and tensor fields are used in a similar way. Vector fields are
a collection of $D$ scalar fields (where $D$ is the dimension of the
spatial discretisation) and tensor fields are a collection of $D$
vector fields. Each of the components of the vector or tensor fields
are accessed using the `x`, `y` or `z` field of the corresponding
structure. For example:

~~~literatec
vector v[];
tensor t = new tensor;
...
foreach() {
  v.x[] = 1.;
  t.x.x[] = (v.x[1,0] - v.x[-1,0])/Delta;
  t.y.x[] = (v.y[1,0] - v.y[-1,0])/Delta;
}
...
delete ({t});
~~~

### Boundary conditions

Stencils located close enough to the boundaries of the domain will
extend beyond it. The stencil values outside the domain (often called
*ghost values*) need to be initialised. These values can be set in
order to provide the discrete equivalents of various boundary
conditions. 

The default boundary condition is *symmetry* and takes into account
whether the fields are scalars, vectors or tensors. If we consider a 
boundary, a scalar field `a` and a vector field `v`, symmetry can be 
expressed on the boundary as:

$$\partial_n a=0$$
$$\partial_n v_t=0$$
$$v_n=0$$

with `n` and `t` the normal and tangential directions to the boundary,
respectively.

Boundary conditions can be changed for each scalar field using the
following syntax:

~~~literatec
a[top] = a[];
~~~

where `a[top]` is the ghost value of the scalar field `a` immediately
outside the `top` (respectively `bottom`, `right`, `left`)
boundary. In this example we have set a symmetry condition on scalar
field `a` on the top boundary (i.e. the default boundary
condition). This corresponds to a Neumann condition (i.e. a condition
on the normal derivative of field `a`). To set a Dirichlet condition
instead (i.e. a condition on the value of the function on the
boundary), one could use for example:

~~~literatec
a[left] = 2.*ab - a[];
~~~

where `ab` is the Dirichlet value on the (left) boundary.

The library also provides functions for common boundary conditions. For
example the expression for the Dirichlet condition above could also be 
written

~~~literatec
a[left] = dirichlet(ab);
~~~

and the Neumann condition

$$
\partial_na=a_n
$$

would be

~~~literatec
a[left] = neumann(an);
~~~

(the equivalent discrete expression is left as an exercise).

Note also that using these pre-defined expressions is necessary to
obtain automatic [*homogeneous boundary 
conditions*](/src/poisson.h/#homogeneous-boundary-conditions), which
is important if scalar `a` is the solution of a Poisson problem (see also [the section below](#homogeneous-boundary-conditions)).

For vector fields, boundary conditions are defined in a coordinate
system local to the boundary where the `x` and `y` components are
replaced by the normal `n` and tangential `t` components i.e. imposing
no-flux of a vector `v` through the `top` and `left` boundary,
together with a no-slip boundary condition would be written

~~~literatec
v.n[top] = dirichlet(0);
v.t[top] = dirichlet(0);
v.n[left] = dirichlet(0);
v.t[left] = dirichlet(0);
~~~

In three dimensions, there is one normal direction `n` and two 
tangential directions `t` and `r`, the `+z` and `-z` boundaries are 
called `front` and `back`. Taking the left (`-x`) or right (`+x`)
boundary as an example, we have the correspondence

~~~
u.n -> u.x
u.t -> u.y
u.r -> u.z
~~~

The relations for the other boundaries (`top/bottom`, `front/back`) 
are obtained by rotation of the indices.

### Periodic boundaries

Periodic boundary conditions can be imposed on the right/left, top/bottom 
and front/back boundaries using for example

~~~literatec
int main()
{
  ...
  periodic (right); 
  ...
}
~~~

All existing fields and all the fields allocated after the call will
be periodic in the right/left direction.

## Events

Numerical simulations often need to perform actions (outputs for
example) at given time intervals. Because the timestep used to
integrate the numerical scheme can vary, for example due to stability
requirements, it is generally not trivial to ensure that specific time
intervals will be respected. To solve this problem Basilisk C provides
*events*.

The overall syntax of events is similar to that of *for* loops in
C. For example:

~~~literatec
event name (t = 1; t <= 5; t += 1) {
  ...
}
~~~

where `name` is the user-defined name of the event, `t = 1` specifies
the starting time, `t <= 5` is the condition which must be verified
for the event to carry on and `t += 1` is the iteration operator. The
event can happen either at specified times `t` or at a specified
number of timesteps `i`.

Beyond this similarity with *for* loops, the syntax for events is more
flexible. The order of the initialisation, condition and iteration
statements can change and/or some of the statements can be
omitted. For example, these are all valid events:

~~~literatec
event name (t = 1; t += 1; t <= 5) {
  // same as previously
  ...
}

event example1 (t = 2) {
  // executes once at t = 2
  ...
}

event example2 (i++) {
  // executes at every timestep
  ...
}

event example3 (t = 1; t *= 2) {
  // executes at t = 1,2,4,8,16,...
  ...
}
~~~

In addition, lists can be used to set specific times/timesteps:

~~~literatec
event example4 (t = {1.2, 3, 7.6}) {
  ...
}
~~~

and the special `end` keyword can be used for events which should
happen after completion of the simulation:

~~~literatec
event example5 (t = end) {
  ...
}
~~~

It is also possible to stop a simulation based on the return value
from an event. For example:

~~~literatec
event stop (i += 10) {
  if (my_stopping_condition())
    return 1; // any value different from zero will stop the simulation
  // the default is to return zero
}

event finalize (t = end) {
  // this will happen after the simulation has completed due to 
  // the "stop" event above
}
~~~

# Part II: More advanced concepts

## Lists

It is often useful to perform the same operation on several
fields. Basilisk C provides a simple extension which allows iterations
over *lists* of fields.

### Declaration and allocation

An automatic list (of scalars) can be declared and allocated like this:

~~~literatec
scalar * list = {a,b,c,d};
~~~

### Automatic type casting

Lists can combine elements of different types (e.g. scalar fields and
vector fields). In this case the type of the resulting list is always
that of the element with the lowest dimension. For example, these are
valid list declarations:

~~~literatec
scalar a[];
vector v[];
tensor t[];
...
scalar * list1 = {a,v,t};
vector * list2 = {v,t};
~~~

however trying

~~~literatec
vector * list3 = {a,v,t};
tensor * list4 = {v,t};
~~~

will give a compilation error.

### Explicit type casting

In a similar way it is sometimes useful to be able to explictly cast
lists of different types. For example a list of vector fields can be
cast into a list of scalar fields using:

~~~literatec
vector * l1 = {a,b,c};
scalar * l2 = (scalar *) l1;
~~~

Explicit type casting is only allowed from a type of higher dimension
down to a type of lower dimension (i.e. tensors to vectors and
vectors to scalars).

### List iterators

To iterate over all the elements of a list use

~~~literatec
scalar * list = {a,b,c,d};
...
for (scalar s in list)
  dosomething (s);
~~~

It is also possible to iterate over two lists (of the same length)
simultaneously using e.g.:

~~~literatec
scalar * l1 = ...;
vector * l2 = ...;
...
scalar s; vector v;
for (s,v in l1,l2)
  dosomething (s, v);
~~~

Finally note that it is much more efficient to do:

~~~literatec
foreach()
  for (scalar s in list)
    s[] = ...;
~~~

rather than

~~~literatec
for (scalar s in list)
  foreach()
    s[] = ...;
~~~

because fields values for each scalar are usually stored close to one
another (this is similar to ordering loops properly when accessing
multidimensional arrays in C or Fortran).

## Face and vertex fields

Discretisation schemes often rely on special arrangements of
discretisation variables relative to the underlying grid (this is
sometimes called *variable staggering*). Basilisk provides support for
the three most common types of staggering: centered (the default),
face and vertex staggering.

![Example of centered, face and vertex staggering](/wiki/src/figures/staggering.svg)

How to implement such *staggering* is largely a matter of
convention. For example, one could just allocate standard fields in
Basilisk and take as convention that the corresponding variables are
staggered. While this would work in simple cases, some operations
performed by Basilisk (such as interpolation and boundary conditions)
need to know that these fields are staggered. Basilisk C introduces
two special keywords for this purpose: *face* and *vertex*. For
example, the fields in the example above would be declared

~~~literatec
scalar p[];
face vector u[];
vertex scalar omega[];
~~~

### Boundary conditions and stencils

Boundary conditions and stencils are necessarily different when
considering cell-centered and staggered variables.

For *vertex* fields, Basilisk does not apply any boundary
conditions. All the vertex values need to be defined using
[*foreach_vertex()*](Basilisk C#foreach_vertex).

For *face* fields stencil values in the picture below are consistent.

![Stencils for *face* and *vertex* fields](/wiki/src/figures/stencil_face.svg)

## Homogeneous boundary conditions

When solving linear systems iteratively (e.g. using the [multigrid solver](/src/poisson.h/#multigrid-solver)), the homogeneous versions of boundary conditions applied to the unknown field are required.

They can be specified through functions using the `..._homogeneous` postfix. See the definitions of the [dirichlet() and neumann() functions](/src/grid/cartesian-common.h/#dirichlet) and their homogeneous versions for an example.

## (Maybe) Constant fields

Partial differential equations often include important particular cases for which one or more fields are constant (in space and/or time) rather than variable. One can think for example of the case of the Navier-Stokes equations with a constant density. To deal with this particular case with an existing variable-density (Navier-Stokes) solver one could simply do something like:

~~~literatec
const double rho0 = ...;
foreach()
  rho[] = rho0;
~~~

This is obviously not optimal since an entire field is used to store (and access) the same value (`rho0`) for each grid point. A solution would then be to replace every instance of `rho[]` in the source code of the solver with `rho0` but this is very cumbersome since there would now be two solvers. This becomes even worse when more than one field can be constant, since the number of variants grows like the number of constant/variable combinations.

To solve this optimisation problem, the Basilisk C preprocessor automatically generates multiple versions of the source code which dynamically take into account whether the fields used are constant or variable. This "branching code" generation is done only for fields which "may be constant", in order to minimize the combinatorial explosion of branches. These fields are declared using the `(const)` type qualifier like this:

~~~literatec
(const) scalar s;
(const) face vector f;
...
~~~

They must then be allocated (and initialised) using either a (variable) field allocation e.g. like this:

~~~literatec
  s = new scalar;
  foreach()
    s[] = x;
  f = new vector;
  foreach_face()
    f.x[] = x*y;
~~~

or a constant field allocation and initialisation like this:

~~~literatec
  s[] = 1.;
  f[] = {2,3};
~~~

Note that the `foreach()` operators must not be specified.

The declaration and initialisation of constant fields can also be combined like this:

~~~literatec
(const) scalar s[] = 1.;
(const) face vector f[] = {2,3};
...
~~~

## Layers

For some problems for which the aspect ratio (vertical/horizontal) is small --
like the ocean or the atmosphere -- it might be useful to use a custom vertical
coordinate. To use this extension, one must define

~~~literatec
#define LAYERS 1
~~~

in the header. The number of layers is set by the variable nl (by default 
`nl = 1` ). You can then declare layered variables via

~~~literatec
scalar h = new scalar[nl];
vector u = new vector[nl];
face vector hu = new face vector[nl];
...
~~~

Such layered variables correspond to `nl` stacked 1D or 2D fields. You need to
cleanup these fields at the end of the execution because they are not automatic
variables:

~~~literatec
event cleanup (t = end, last)
{
  delete ({h, u, hu});
}
~~~

This layered module comes with an iterator `foreach_layer()` which must be
included within a global field iterator (e.g. `foreach()` etc.)

~~~literatec
foreach()
  foreach_layer()
    a[] = 1.;
~~~

Within a `foreach()` iterator, you can also access a
specific layer with the last index in the bracket as shown below for layer 10 on a 2D grid.

~~~literatec
foreach()
  a[0,0,10] = 1.;
~~~

Note that the layer index is always relative to the current layer. For example:

~~~literatec
foreach()
  foreach_layer() {
    // This accesses the layer immediately above, except for the top layer
    a[0,0,1] ...
    // This accesses the layer immediately below, except for the bottom layer
    a[0,0,-1] ...
  }
~~~

## Field attributes

Scalar field can have associated "attributes" which behave very much 
like "members" of C structures. To add a new attribute (to all scalar 
fields) use something like

~~~literatec
attribute {
  int myattribute;
}
~~~

You can then access this attribute using

~~~literatec
scalar s[];
s.myattribute = 2;
~~~

Of course you are not limited to *int*, you can use any declaration 
which would be legal in a C structure, provided the new name does 
not conflict with the names of existing attributes.

If the attribute is not set explicitly, it defaults to "zero".

### Pre-defined attributes

## Point function calls

Using the `Point` variable, It is possible to make stencil accesses
and use automatic point variables outside iterators. For example,

~~~literatec
double distance_to_origin (Point point) {
  return sqrt(sq(x) + sq(y) + sq(z));
}
~~~

or, 

~~~literatec
double sum_right_neighbors_2D (Point point, scalar s) {
  double a = 0;
  for (int i = -1; i < 2; i++) 
     a += s[1,i];
  return a;	
}
~~~

Note that the variable of type `Point` *must* be named `point`.

<div class="bd-callout bd-callout-warning">
Note that the syntax

~~~literatec
Point point = locate (...);
~~~

is deprecated and will be removed in the future. See [`foreach_point()`](#foreach_point) and [`foreach_region()`](#foreach_region) for (better) alternatives. </div>

## More field iterators

We have already seen the basic field iterator `foreach()`. While many
numerical schemes can be implemented using only this iterator, more
efficient and elegant implementations can often be designed using
other iterators provided by Basilisk.

### `foreach_dimension()`

As an example, consider the code required to compute

$$g=\nabla a$$

Using a centered scheme, this could be written:

~~~literatec
scalar a[];
vector g[];
...
foreach() {
  g.x[] = (a[1,0] - a[-1,0])/(2.*Delta);
  g.y[] = (a[0,1] - a[0,-1])/(2.*Delta);
}
~~~

It is clear that computing `g.y` is almost identical to computing
`g.x`, all that is required is a permutation of the indices. Most
multi-dimensional schemes involve similar permutations. Writing these
permutations manually, as we did above, is error-prone and leads to
code duplication. While this may be acceptable for the simple example
above, this can become very heavy for more complicated schemes. To
avoid this Basilisk provides the `foreach_dimension()` iterator which
can be used like this:

~~~literatec
...
foreach()
  foreach_dimension()
    g.x[] = (a[1,0] - a[-1,0])/(2.*Delta);
~~~

At compilation, the code block associated with `foreach_dimension()`
(a single line in this example) will be automatically duplicated for
each dimension of the problem with the appropriate coordinate
permutations: `.x` will become `.y`, `.y` will become `.x` (or `.z` in
3D) etc... and the field indices will be rotated correspondingly.

Any variable or function identifier ending with `_x`, `_y` and `_z`
will also be rotated.

The `right`, `left`, `top`, `bottom`, `front` and `back` direction 
indicators will also be rotated.

### `foreach_face()`

The `foreach()` operator can be seen as iterating over the *cells* of
the grid. When writing *flux-based* schemes it is often useful to
consider iterations over the *faces* of each cell (because fluxes are
by definition associated with cell faces).

Implementing an iteration over cell faces using only the `foreach()`
operator is not easy, even for a one-dimensional problem, due to
boundary conditions. Things also become more complex when considering
multi-dimensional and adaptive grids. The `foreach_face()` field
iterator solves these problems by providing a consistent traversal of
cell faces in all cases.

For example, computing the components of $\nabla a$ normal to each face
can be written:

~~~literatec
scalar a[];
face vector g[];
...
foreach_face()
  g.x[] = (a[] - a[-1,0])/Delta;
~~~

Note that a face is defined by convention as separating a cell from
its *left* neighbour (hence `a[-1,0]` and not `a[1,0]`, see the [Face
and vertex fields section](#face-and-vertex-fields)
above). Note also that the duplication/permutation performed by
`foreach_dimension()` is implicitly included in `foreach_face()`.

In some cases, it can be necessary to apply different operations to
each component of a face vector field. For example let's assume we
need to initialise a face vector field with the components
`(y,x)`. This could be done using

~~~literatec
face vector u[];
...
foreach_face(x)
  u.x[] = y;
foreach_face(y)
  u.y[] = x;
~~~

Note that the coordinates `x` and `y` correspond to the center of the
face.

### `foreach_vertex()`

When initialising [vertex fields](#face-and-vertex-fields),
it is necessary to traverse each vertex of the grid. For example,
computing vorticity using the components of velocity defined on faces
could be written

~~~literatec
face vector u[];
vertex scalar omega[];
...
foreach_vertex()
  omega[] = (u.y[] - u.y[-1,0] - u.x[] + u.x[0,-1])/Delta;
~~~

Consistently with the other iterators, the `x` and `y` declared
implicitly within `foreach_vertex()` loops are the coordinates of the
vertex.

### `foreach_boundary()`

It is sometimes useful to be able to traverse only the cells which are
touching a given boundary, for example to compute surface fluxes and
other diagnostics. While using a combination of `foreach()` and
conditions on cell coordinates would be possible, it would also be
inefficient and could be difficult when using adaptive meshes. For
this reason, Basilisk provides the `foreach_boundary()` iterator which
can be used like this for example:

~~~literatec
scalar a[];
...
double mu = 1., flux = 0.;
foreach_boundary (top)
  flux += sq(Delta)*mu*(a[ghost] - a[])/Delta;
~~~

where *top* indicates which boundary we want to traverse (the keywords
are the same as used for [boundary conditions](#boundary-conditions))
and *ghost* is the index of the corresponding ghost cell: for this
example `a[ghost] == a[0,1]`.

This example computes the (diffusive) flux of `a` through the top
boundary. Note that for this to work in parallel you would also need
to add a [reduction clause](#parallel-programming) on `flux` in
foreach_boundary().

`foreach_boundary()` iterates over the cells which are
touching a given boundary but the coordinates `x,y,z` correspond not the center of the cells but the coordinates of a given boundary.

### `foreach_neighbor()`

This iterator is local to a cell, so it must be included within a
global field iterator (e.g. `foreach()` etc.). It will iterate over
all the cells belonging to the local stencil i.e. the 5x5 stencil by
default (in 2D). This can optionally be reduced to a 3x3 stencil
(i.e. only the nearest neighbors) using the syntax
`foreach_neighbor(1)`.

### `foreach_point()`

This iterator will only traverse the cell containing the "point" with the given coordinates. For example

~~~literatec
int main() {
  init_grid (N);
  scalar s[];
  foreach_point (0.4, 0.6)
    s[] = sqrt(sq(x) + sq(y)); 
}
~~~

is a valid (MPI) Basilisk program, where the scalar field `s` is only
initialized in a single cell.

### `foreach_region()`

This is similar to `foreach_point()` but will traverse the cells containing all the points sampled within a rectangular region. For example

~~~literatec
coord p;
coord box[2] = {{0, 0}, {1, 2}};
coord n = {10, 20};
foreach_region (p, box, n) {
  ...
}
~~~

will sample 10 x 20 points (with coordinates given by `p`) regularly distributed within [0:1] x [0:2].

## Event inheritance

In contrast with C functions, multiple events can share the same
name. This is used to implement
[inheritance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_%28object-oriented_programming%29)
of existing events and allows to modify and extend the functionality of
existing solvers.

When two (or more) events have the same name, the order of execution
of this group is modified. The following rules are applied:

* all events in the group are executed "together",
* the first event in the group (in order of appearance in the source
  files), sets the point where the group is executed,
* within a group, the order of execution is the *inverse* of the order
  of appearance in the source files.

Although this may seem complicated, these rules work well in practice
and lead to a reasonably simple inheritance mechanism.

A trace of the order of execution of events can be obtained using the
compilation option:

~~~bash
% qcc -events ...
~~~

The resulting code will then output (on standard error) a trace looking like:

~~~bash
...
events (i = 4, t = 0.00191154)
  logfile                   rising.c:131
  set_dtmax                 src/navier-stokes/centered.h:163
  stability                 src/tension.h:59
  stability                 src/vof.h:44
  stability                 src/navier-stokes/centered.h:165
  vof                       src/vof.h:174
  vof                       src/navier-stokes/centered.h:175
  tracer_advection          src/navier-stokes/centered.h:176
...
~~~

There are two event groups in this example: *stability* and
*vof*. They correspond to extensions of the initial solver
[/src/navier-stokes/centered.h/](): adding the stability conditions for
surface tension (at line 59 of [/src/tension.h/]()) and for VOF (at
line 44 of [/src/vof.h/]()) and plugging in VOF advection (at line 174
of [/src/vof.h/]()) at the correct location (line 175 of
[/src/navier-stokes/centered.h/]()).

## Grid allocation and deallocation

A grid needs to be allocated before use (for example before using a
loop iterator). This can be done using

~~~literatec
init_grid (32);
~~~

where `32` here is the number of grid points in each dimension. This
will also set the value of the global variable `N` to 32. Note that
many pre-defined solvers call `init_grid()` within the `run()`
function, using `N` as the number of grid points.

Explicitly freeing a grid is done using

~~~literatec
free_grid();
~~~

Note that `init_grid()` will call `free_grid()` before allocating the new grid.

Basilisk is designed so that it is simple to change the type, the
number of dimensions, and/or the implementations of the grids. There
are three broad categories of grids -- cartesian, multigrid and tree --
organised in the hierarchical fashion illustrated below

![Hierarchy of grids (note that not all operators are
 shown)](hierarchy.svg){width="80%"}

The simplest grid is cartesian and supports the operations indicated
in green. Multigrid adds multiple resolution levels and the
corresponding operators in blue. Quadtree restricts the resolution of
each level and adds the operators in red. A code using only green
operators will run on all grids. A code using green and blue operators
will run on multigrid and quadtree, and a code using green, blue and
red operators will run only on quadtree.

### Changing the grid

One can change the grid using for example

~~~literatec
#include "grid/multigrid.h"
~~~

where the include statement must appear before any other include. Of
course it is not possible to have multiple `#include "grid/..."`
statements. If no such statement is included, the default corresponds
to `#include "grid/quadtree.h"`.

Why not use only the quadtree grid since it can do everything? A first
reason is performance. The memory management of a quadtree
implementation is not simple and will generally be less efficient than
a simpler cartesian or multigrid implementation. This is even more
relevant when using parallel, multicore computing. If one does not use
the capabilities of the quadtree (i.e. the adaptive resolution), then
it is more efficient to switch to multigrid (or even cartesian if one
does not use the multilevel capability).

Note also that one can use different implementations of the same grid
type, adapted to a different hardware. For example a [GPU-accelerated
multigrid](/src/grid/gpu/grid.h) using

~~~literatec
#include "grid/gpu/multigrid.h"
~~~

Another useful way to change the grid, without changing the source
code, is using the `-grid` command line argument of [qcc](/src/qcc.c),
like this for example

~~~bash
qcc -grid=gpu/multigrid ...
~~~

Note that the command-line argument will have priority over any
`#include "grid/...` statement in the source code.

### One, two or three dimensions

The second reason to change the grid is to change the number of
dimensions of the system. The hierarchy above, illustrated in two
dimensions, is also implemented 

* in one dimension: with `cartesian1D.h`, `multigrid1D.h` and `bitree.h`,
* and in three dimensions: with `multigrid3D.h` and `octree.h` (there is no `cartesian3D.h`).

Basilisk includes several mechanisms which make it quite easy to write
codes which can run with an arbitrary number of dimensions:

* the [foreach_dimension()](#foreach_dimension) iterator above,
* the automatic "collapse" of higher dimension indices i.e. when
  evaluating the field value `s[a,b]` in one dimension, the `b` index
  is simply ignored.

### Multigrids

Besides the general properties above, the multigrid implementations
add some functionalities not present in other grids, including
[non-square or non-cubic domains](/src/Tips#non-cubic-domains).

### Adaptive grids

Adaptive grids are necessarily using the tree grids implementations
(bitree, quadtree or octree). Note that the current implementations do
not support non-square or non-cubic domains.

## Metric

## Macros

Basilisk macros are defined using the `macro` keyword. They provide a
cleaner and more robust interface than standard C preprocessor macros
and can in particular be used to define new
[iterators](#iterators). See the documentation in
[macro.h](/src/ast/macro.h/).

## Diagonalization

The `diagonalize(s)` operator replaces the central stencil value of
the scalar field `s` (i.e. `s[]`) with one and its other values with
zero, in all operations within the following C statement. This is
typically used to automatically construct Jacobi relaxation operators
for multigrid solutions of linear systems.

## Einstein summation

The `einstein_sum()` operator can be used to perform automatic [Einstein summation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_notation) on the components of tensors and vectors. See the documentation in [einstein_sum.h](/wiki/src/ast/einstein_sum.h).

## Dimensional Analysis

The Basilisk C preprocessor [qcc](/src/qcc.c) performs sophisticated [Dimensional Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis). Within this framework, the dimensions of numerical constants are given using "standard" C array indexing. For example the following syntax:

~~~literatec
double g = 9.81 [1,-2];
~~~

indicates that the constant `9.81` has dimension `[1,-2]` (typically the dimension of an acceleration).

Other useful special functions include `show_dimension()` and `dimensional()`.

Note that these extensions are only used symbolically during preprocessing and do not affect in any way the actual compilation or execution of the program.

See also the [Dimensional Analysis Tutorial](/Tutorial.dimensions) for detailed explanations.

## Named/optional arguments in function calls

C++ allows named and optional arguments in function calls, for example:

~~~c
void example (float f = 0, double d = 0);
...
example (f = 2); // d = 0
example (d = 4, f = 1.2);
~~~

Unfortunately this is not allowed in C99. Basilisk C includes an
extension which provides this functionality.

## Parallel programming

Basilisk can automatically parallelise field iterations
(i.e. `foreach()` etc...) on systems supporting
[OpenMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenMP),
[MPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface) or [on
Graphics Processing Units (GPUs)](/src/grid/gpu/grid.h). If the
*write* operations performed on stencils are purely local
(i.e. concurrent accesses by several threads are only possible for
*read* operations), then nothing special needs to be done to
parallelise the corresponding field iteration.

A classical example where this condition is not verified are
*reduction operations*. Consider for example the function:

~~~literatec
double maximum (scalar a) {
  double maxi = - HUGE;
  foreach()
    if (fabs(a[]) > maxi)
      maxi = fabs(a[]);
  return maxi;
}
~~~

In this example, if the `foreach()` iteration is performed in
parallel, several threads may try to set the `maxi` variable
simultaneously (this is a concurrent *write* access). If this happens
the result returned by the function will be incorrect. 

Similarly, when using MPI parallelism, each process will only hold a local
`maxi` value, whereas a global value is required.

To cover this common pattern, OpenMP provides [*reduction
operators*](https://www.openmp.org/spec-html/5.0/openmpsu107.html) 
which can be used in Basilisk like this:

~~~literatec
double maximum (scalar a) {
  double maxi = - 1e100;
  foreach (reduction(max:maxi))
    if (fabs(a[]) > maxi)
      maxi = fabs(a[]);
  return maxi;
}
~~~

It is also possible to reduce an array by indicating its length. For example, one could count the number of leafs cells at each level by writing:

~~~literatec
  int len = grid->maxdepth + 1, cells[len] = {0};
  foreach (reduction(+:cells[:len]))
    cells[level]++;
~~~

Note that Basilisk generalises reduction operators so that they work
also with MPI parallelism.

Beyond reduction operations, care must be taken to avoid concurrent
write accesses when writing Basilik code. Consider the following code
which makes use of an auxilliary variable to store an intermediate
result:

~~~literatec
  double norm;
  foreach() {
    norm = sqrt(sq(u.x[]) + sq(u.y[]));
    a[] = norm;
    b[] = norm/2.;
  }
~~~

The code will work fine in serial (or with MPI), however it will fail
when using shared-memory parallelism (i.e. OpenMP), because `norm`
will be shared amongst threads and written to concurrently. The
solution is simple: just make `norm` a variable local to the loop body
i.e.

~~~literatec
  foreach() {
    double norm = sqrt(sq(u.x[]) + sq(u.y[]));
    a[] = norm;
    b[] = norm/2.;
  }
~~~

Each thread then has its own private `norm` variable and concurrent
accesses are avoided. Note that this is also a cleaner/clearer way of
writing code, even for the serial version. Generally speaking,
variables should be declared/allocated as closely as possible to where
they are used.

By default Basilisk will parallelise all iterators. This can be a
problem, for example when writing data to a file. Serial iterations
for individual loops can be forced like this:

~~~literatec
  foreach (serial)
    printf ("%g %g %g\n", x, y, a[]);
~~~

## Tracing and profiling

The `trace` keyword is used to indicate that the function immediately
following should be instrumented for [built-in
profiling](/src/README.trace) or [profiling with
Paraver](/src/README.paraver).  For example one could write

~~~literatec
trace
double maximum (scalar a) {
...
~~~
