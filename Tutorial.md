This tutorial is a step by step description on how to setup, compile
and run your first Basilisk simulation.

What you need:

* You need to have at least a minimal understanding of *[shell
  commands](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell)*. If
  you don't know what I am talking about, you may want to start with
  one of the many online tutorials on this subject, such as [Learning
  the shell](http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_learning_the_shell.php).
* You will also need a good text editor to write (C) programs in
  Basilisk. If you do not have a favourite one already, I recommend
  using emacs. You can install it easily on Debian-like systems by
  copying and pasting the following command in your shell: 

~~~bash
sudo apt install emacs
~~~

* Because Basilisk programs are written in a variant of the C
  language, any prior knowledge of C programming you may have will be
  very useful. If you have never seen a C program, you may want to
  read up on the topic, for example:

    + [C Language Tutorial ](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/)
    + [*The C programming language*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language)

* You then need to follow the [installation
  instructions](src/INSTALL) to setup basilisk on your system.
  
* If you are using a Mac please see special installation instructions 
  for [make and gdb](/sandbox/INSTALL_MACOS). 

# Getting started

You first need to open both a terminal and a text editor. On my
system (Debian), the terminal is hidden in the "Activities ->
Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal" menu. You can then start the
text editor in the background by typing:

~~~bash
emacs &
~~~

To check that Basilisk is installed properly, do:

~~~bash
qcc --version
~~~

which returns on my system

    cc (Debian 10.2.1-6) 10.2.1 20210110
    Copyright (C) 2020 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
    This is free software; see the source for copying conditions.  There is NO
    warranty; not even for MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

If instead you get an error message, you need to go back to the
[installation instructions](src/INSTALL) and check that you did
everything correctly.

# The simulation

The model problem we will study is a numerical approximation of the
solution of the Saint-Venant equations in a square box with reflecting
boundaries.

To create the Basilisk program, use the "File -> Visit New File" menu
in emacs and type *bump.c* in the *Name* field. Then type the
following line ...

~~~literatec
#include "saint-venant.h"
~~~

... and save the file using the "File -> Save" menu (or the Control-X
Control-S keyboard shortcut). This C preprocessor command, includes
the [saint-venant.h](src/saint-venant.h) file into our program. This
file defines all the variables and functions which are required to run
the Saint-Venant solver of Basilisk. If you follow the link above, you
will see that the corresponding code is documented. Now is a good time
to read the [first two sections](src/saint-venant.h) (up to [*Time
integration*](src/saint-venant.h#time-integration)) to remind yourself
of what the equations, variables and parameters are...

## Minimal program

We can now try to compile our program using (in the shell)

~~~bash
qcc bump.c
~~~

which produces something like

    (.text+0x20): undefined reference to `main'
    /tmp/ccueSq1Z.o: In function `normf':
    bump.c:(.text+0x262d2): undefined reference to `sqrt'
    ...

The compiler (or more precisely the *linker*), complains that some
functions are used but not defined. The *sqrt* function for example is
defined in the standard *math* library which needs to be linked with
the program. The *main* function however needs to be defined by us.
Note that all this is not specific to Basilisk, it is just standard C.

To fix this problem, we need to add

~~~literatec
#include "saint-venant.h"

int main() {
  run();
}
~~~

to *bump.c* (using the text editor). If you have some notions of C
(i.e. you have done the homework given above...), you will recognise
the definition of a C function called *main* which takes no parameters
and just calls the function *run*. The *run()* function is defined by
the Saint-Venant solver (i.e. is included in
[saint-venant.h](src/saint-venant.h)).

We can now save the file and recompile using (in the shell)

~~~bash
qcc bump.c -lm
~~~

If we now type *ls* in the shell, we will see that this produced a
file called *a.out* which is the compiled program, which we can launch
using

~~~bash
./a.out
~~~

which gives

    # Quadtree, 0 steps, 0 CPU, 0.001075 real, 0 points.step/s, 5 var

Amazing! we have done our first Basilisk simulation!

If you have compiled C programs before, you will see that all we have
done here is very standard C, very little is specific to Basilisk. For
example the *-lm* option is the standard way to link the math library
(which defines the *sqrt* function i.e. square-root and other math
functions). More generally, because the *qcc* command calls the C
compiler in the background, you can use all the options supported by
the C compiler. For example, if you are using GCC, it is a good idea
to use

~~~bash
qcc -O2 -Wall bump.c -o bump -lm
~~~

where *-O2* turns optimisation on (which makes the code faster),
*-Wall* turns all compilation warnings on (which allows you to catch
potential bugs in your program) and *-o bump* renames the compiled
program to *bump* (rather than *a.out*).

# A more interesting program

Of course our program does not do much yet. So why did we start with
such a simple program? Because it is always a good idea to start
simple and add complexity step-by-step. If a problem occurs in a
single line of code, which you have just added, it is trivial to
correct it. If this same line is buried within ten other (correct)
lines, finding the problem can take (much) longer. This rule is true
whether you are an experienced programmer or a beginner.

To make the program more interesting, it needs to produce some
*outputs* at specified times. To do so, we can use [events](Basilisk
C#events); like this for example:

~~~literatec
#include "saint-venant.h"

event end (i = 10) {
  printf ("i = %d t = %g\n", i, t);
}

int main() {
  run();
}
~~~

What we have done here is told the solver to do 10 timesteps and then
print the number of timesteps and the physical time it reached after
10 timesteps. If we now recompile using

~~~bash
qcc -O2 -Wall bump.c -o bump -lm
~~~

(note that you do not need to retype this command, you can just use
the up and down keyboard arrows to go through the history of previous
commands), and run using

~~~bash
./bump
~~~

we get something like

    i = 10 t = 1e+11
    # Quadtree, 10 steps, 0.04 CPU, 0.06103 real, 6.71e+05 points.step/s, 24 var

The first line comes from our code and the second line is the default
output of basilisk. It gives the number of timesteps performed, the
CPU time used for the computation, the real time elapsed, the
corresponding computation speed (based on the real time) and the total
number of [fields](Basilisk C#fields-and-stencils) allocated by the
solver.

The syntax of events is specific to Basilisk (it is not standard C),
however the *body* of the event works just like a standard C
function. To learn more about events, have a look at the [Basilisk C
reference manual](Basilisk C#events). Here we have used the standard C
[printf](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/printf.3.html#1)
function to format the output. 

Note that you can access the manual page for this function using
either the link above or directly using the *man* command in the shell
or in emacs (use the "Help -> More Manuals -> Read Man Page" menu and
type "3 printf").

~~~bash
man 3 printf
~~~

This can also be used to access the documentation for (almost) any
command or program (for example [*man
ls*](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ls.1.html#1), [*man
cp*](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/cp.1.html#1) etc...) and is
a good way to learn.

## Initial conditions

For the moment, the solver just uses the default initial conditions of
the Saint-Venant solver. We need to replace them with our own initial
conditions.

By default the domain on which the equations are solved is a square
box with reflective boundaries (i.e. symmetry conditions on scalar,
vector and tensor fields). The origin of the coordinate system is the
lower-left corner of the box and the box length is one. We can change
this using the *origin()* and *size()* functions. For example, we can do:

~~~literatec
...

int main() {
  origin (-0.5, -0.5);
  run();
}
~~~

which will center our box on the origin of the coordinate system.

Initial conditions are setup using the *init* event, like this:

~~~literatec
#include "saint-venant.h"

event init (t = 0) {
  double a = 1., b = 200.;
  foreach()
    h[] = 0.1 + a*exp(- b*(x*x + y*y));
}

event end (i = 10) {
  printf ("i = %d t = %g\n", i, t);
}

int main() {
  origin (-0.5, -0.5);
  run();
}
~~~

The *init* event will happen only at the beginning of the simulation
($t=0$). Within the body of the event, we use the Basilisk-specific
[foreach](Basilisk C#iterators) iterator to set the values of field
*h* (the depth of the liquid layer as defined and documented in the
[Saint-Venant solver](src/saint-venant.h)). We use a Gaussian bump of
characteristic radius $1./\sqrt{200}$ and amplitude one on top of a
layer of constant depth 0.1. The *x* and *y* coordinates are *double*
values defined implicitly by the *foreach* operator.

If we now recompile and rerun, we get

    i = 10 t = 0.0701117
    # Quadtree, 10 steps, 0.06 CPU, 0.09314 real, 4.4e+05 points.step/s, 24 var

## More outputs

For the moment, we don't see much. Some graphical output would be
nice. To generate simple images, we can use the *output_ppm()*
function like this

~~~literatec
...

event images (i++) {
  output_ppm (h);
}

event end (i = 10)
...
~~~

Recompiling and running, we get something like

    ...
    ï¿½mï¿½ï¿½mï¿½ï¿½mï¿½ï¿½mï¿½ï¿½mï¿½ï¿½mï¿½
    ï¿½# Quadtree, 11 steps, 0.25 CPU, 0.5423 real, 8.31e+04 points.step/s, 24 var

What is all this garbage? By default, *output_ppm()* writes images on
*standard output* (see [Learning the
shell](http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_learning_the_shell.php) if you don't
understand what this means). Standard output is the shell (i.e. the
screen) by default. The strange characters we see on the screen are a
translation of the binary contents of the images generated (at each
timestep) by *output_ppm()*. We can change the standard output to a
file rather than the screen using

~~~bash
./bump > out.ppm
~~~

where we used the *.ppm* extension to indicate that this file should
contain images in [PPM
format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm_format). This format is
recognised by many image processing
tools. [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org) in particular
provides nice command-line tools to manipulate these images. If you
have not done so already, now is a good time to install ImageMagick
and other graphics tools.

~~~bash
sudo apt install gnuplot imagemagick ffmpeg
~~~

We can now try to use the *display* command of ImageMagick to
display the images which should be in *out.ppm*.

~~~bash
display out.ppm
~~~

which should open a small window looking like this

![h](tuto/h.png)

We can right- or left-click on the window to access various
menus. Using the space bar of the keyboard, we can cycle through the
10 images (one for each timestep) contained in *out.ppm*. If you look
carefully, you will see that the radius of the red disk is slowly
increasing with time. What we are looking at is a color-coded
representation of the depth field *h* in the square box. Dark red is
the maximum (one at the start) and light green is the minimum.

Why is the image so small? By default output_ppm() creates images with
one pixel per grid point. If you right-click on the image and select
the "Image Info" menu, you will see that the "geometry" is "64x64"
i.e. the grid on which the equations are discretised is 64x64 grid
points. This is the default in Basilisk. We will change it later.

To make things a bit more interesting, we will increase the number of
timesteps with

~~~literatec
...
event end (i = 300) {
...
~~~

Then re-compile and run using

~~~bash
qcc -O2 -Wall bump.c -o bump -lm
./bump > out.ppm
~~~

We could use *display* to view each of the 300 images we have now
generated, but this would be a bit tedious. We will use another
ImageMagick command instead

~~~bash
animate out.ppm
~~~

What we then see is all the images in quick succession. Once the last
image is reached, the animation loops back to the beginning. This is a
bit fast, we can use the menu or the '>' keyboard shortcut to increase
the delay between successive images (i.e. slow things down). We can
then follow the evolution of the initial Gaussian bump. The circular
wave propagates until it reaches the reflective walls, bounces back,
refocuses in the center, bounces off and so on.

## Simple measurements and graphs

Let's assume we are interested in the evolution of the minimum and
maximum depths as functions of time. We can record these values using
for example

~~~literatec
event graphs (i++) {
  stats s = statsf (h);
  fprintf (stderr, "%g %g %g\n", t, s.min, s.max);
}

event images (i++) {
...
~~~

In the first line, we call the *statsf()* function of Basilisk which
fills the structure *s* with statistics on field *h*. In the second
line, we use the standard C function
[*fprintf()*](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/fprintf.3.html#1)
to write the time, minimum and maximum (of *h*) in the standard C file
[*stderr*](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/stderr.3.html#1). This
stands for "standard error" which by default is the screen.

If we recompile and rerun, we get

    ...
    3.77319 0.087509 0.195247
    3.78692 0.0869611 0.192627
    3.80072 0.0864178 0.189687

We can use file redirection to write these numbers to a file rather
than on the screen. For example

~~~bash
./bump > out.ppm 2> log
~~~

To check what is in *log* we can use

~~~bash
more log
~~~

(use the space bar and the *q* key to scroll down or quit *more*).

We can do better than this if we use a plotting tool,
[gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/) for example. Gnuplot is itself a
command-line tool which has its own set of commands. You can start
gnuplot with

~~~bash
gnuplot
~~~

You will then get a prompt looking like

~~~bash
gnuplot>
~~~

i.e. you are now within gnuplot (not within the shell anymore). To
quit gnuplot and go back to the shell, just type 'quit'. To display a
graph of the min and max of *h* you can then do

~~~bash
gnuplot> set xlabel 'Time'
gnuplot> set ylabel 'Depth'
gnuplot> plot 'log' using 1:2 with lines title 'min', 'log' using 1:3 with lines title 'max' 
~~~

which should produce

![Min and max](tuto/minmax.png)

Read one of the many [tutorials](http://www.gnuplot.info/help.html) if
you want to know more about gnuplot. See also the excellent [gnuplotting.org](https://gnuplotting.org/about/index.html).

# Increasing the resolution

For the moment our mesh is only 64x64. As we can see in the animation
and graphs of the maximum depth, the Saint-Venant equations easily
develop non-linear shocks i.e. sharp discontinuities in the depth
profile. These shocks are probably not well described on this
relatively coarse grid.

To increase the resolution, we can simply do

~~~literatec
...
int main() {
  origin (-0.5, -0.5);
  init_grid (256);
  run();
}
~~~

which will use a 256x256 grid. Why a power of two? Because by default,
Basilisk uses a quadtree grid, which restricts the resolution to
powers of two. We will see later that this is not the case for other
grids.

Before we rerun the simulation, we will save the data we produced at
low resolution using

~~~bash
mv log log.64
mv out.ppm out.64.ppm
~~~

We can now recompile and rerun the simulation. The first thing we note
is that it is much slower. This is not surprising since the number of
grid points has been multiplied by 16 and we can expect the simulation
to be proportionately slower.

If we redo

~~~bash
animate out.ppm
~~~

we get a larger (and sharper) picture of the wave, however it does not
propagate as far as before (it barely touches the walls of the
box). Since we do the same number of timesteps, it must mean that each
timestep is smaller than before. Indeed, the timestep is controled by
the [CFL
condition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courant%E2%80%93Friedrichs%E2%80%93Lewy_condition)
for the Saint-Venant system and is thus proportional to the grid
spacing. In our case we have decreased the grid spacing by a factor of
four, so that we would need four times as many timesteps to reach the
same time as in the previous simulation. Putting this together with
the increase in number of grid points, we can expect the total runtime
to be $16\times 4=64$ times larger than for the previous simulation...

How can we make things faster without loosing the accuracy of the
finer grid?

We could use a faster computer and/or use more processors (use
*parallel* computing).

## Changing the grid

With Basilisk, we also have the choice of the type of grid used to
discretise the equations. Simpler grid structures usually run faster.

To have an idea of how long the simulation took, we can do

~~~bash
tail -n1 out.ppm
~~~

which gives on my machine

    ...
    # Quadtree, 301 steps, 47.85 CPU, 53.98 real, 3.65e+05 points.step/s, 24 var

i.e. the program can do one timestep for 365 000 grid points in one
second (The *tail -n1* command displays the last line of file
*out.ppm*; you can do [*man
tail*](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/tail.1.html#1) to learn
more about this). You also see that this was running on a quadtree
grid implementation (but at constant spatial resolution).

To change the grid used by Basilisk, we can edit the code as

~~~literatec
#include "grid/cartesian.h"
#include "saint-venant.h"
...
~~~

which will force Basilisk to use a pure Cartesian grid
implementation. If we now recompile, rerun and recover the last line
with

~~~bash
qcc -O2 -Wall bump.c -o bump -lm
./bump > out.ppm 2> log
tail -n1 out.ppm
~~~

we get

    ...
    # Cartesian, 301 steps, 22.05 CPU, 25.14 real, 7.85e+05 points.step/s, 24 var

i.e. the Cartesian grid implementation is about twice as fast as the
quadtree implementation (for the same result).

## Setting time intervals

Because the timestep is controlled by the spatial resolution, it is
generally not a good idea to output physical results at regular
intervals expressed in number of timesteps. It makes more sense to
output results at intervals expressed in physical time units.

For example, in our case, we know that our initial simulation ran to a
time of about $t=4$ (see the graph above) and that the 300 images we
generated were sufficient to get a nice animation of the wave
propagation. If we want to reproduce these results at higher
resolution, it thus makes sense to modify our program like this

~~~literatec
...
event images (t += 4./300.) {
  output_ppm (h);
}

event end (t = 4) {
  printf ("i = %d t = %g\n", i, t);
}
...
~~~

where the output intervals are now specified in units of physical time.

We can now recompile, rerun etc... Since this is going to take a
while, it would be nice to be able to follow where the simulation is
at. To do this, you can open a new terminal (for example using the
"File -> Open Tab" menu), and type in the new terminal

~~~bash
tail -f log
~~~

In this case the *tail* command displays what is being written in file
*log*. The left column is the time (which needs to reach 4). You can
exit from *tail* using the Ctrl-C key.

Another way to follow the simulation is to open gnuplot in another
terminal and display the graphs for *h* as we did before. Using the
'replot' command, or clicking on the blue circular arrow in the graph
window, or hitting the 'e' key in the graph window, will refresh the
curves as the simulation progresses.

We can also use *animate* on *out.ppm* while the simulation is
running.

## A rough check for convergence

How do we know if we need to increase the resolution further? A good
way to estimate the numerical accuracy of the solution is to compare
results obtained at different resolutions. We can do this "visually"
with gnuplot

~~~bash
gnuplot> set xlabel 'Time'
gnuplot> set ylabel 'Depth'
gnuplot> plot 'log.64' using 1:2 with lines title 'min (64)', \
              'log.64' using 1:3 with lines title 'max (64)', \
              'log' using 1:2 with lines title 'min (256)', \
              'log' using 1:3 with lines title 'max (256)'
~~~

which gives

![Convergence](tuto/convergence.png)

We see that the peaks and discontinuities are definitely sharper at
higher resolution. Although other parts of the graphs are reasonably
close, we may want to try an even higher resolution to see if the
amplitudes of the peaks converge.

# Using adaptive grid refinement

From the animation and graphs, we intuitively get the sense that the
*characteristic spatial scales* of the waves we are studying are not
constant. Some areas are very smooth with no significant features,
while other areas include fine details (interacting shocks for
example). Clearly, high resolution is not needed everywhere and the
computation could probably be made faster if the resolution was
adapted to the solution. This variable resolution also needs to evolve
in time to follow the moving details.

Basilisk uses quadtrees to allow efficient adaptive grid
refinement. The first thing we need to do is to remove the line
setting the grid to Cartesian i.e.

~~~literatec
#include "grid/cartesian.h"
...
~~~

We can then add

~~~literatec
...
event adapt (i++) {
  adapt_wavelet ({h}, (double []){4e-3}, maxlevel = 8);
}

int main() {
...
~~~

We have just told Basilisk to adapt the resolution according to the
(wavelet-estimated) discretisation error of field *h*. This adaptation
is done at each timestep (*i++*). Whenever the discretisation error is
larger than $4\times 10^{-3}$, the mesh is refined, down to a maximum of 8
quadtree levels (i.e. $2^8=256$ points per dimension).

Before we rerun the simulation, we first save the previous results

~~~bash
mv out.ppm out.256.ppm
mv log log.256
~~~

and then recompile and rerun.

The first thing we note is that the simulation runs significantly
faster. Which is confirmed by

~~~bash
tail -n1 out.ppm
~~~

which gives

    # Quadtree, 1474 steps, 52.15 CPU, 61.65 real, 1.6e+05 points.step/s, 24 var

compared to (*tail -n1 out.256.ppm*)

    # Cartesian, 1485 steps, 96.76 CPU, 113.9 real, 8.54e+05 points.step/s, 24 var

on the regular Cartesian grid i.e. roughly twice as fast with adaptivity.

This looks good at first, however the animation reveals that things
are a bit more complex. In particular, the animation does not look as
smooth; as shown on the following frame

![First-order image interpolation](tuto/out-first.png)

What is happening is that because the resolution varies, there isn't a
one-to-one mapping between grid points and pixels in the image
generated by *output_ppm()*. So interpolation is required. By default
*output_ppm()* uses only first-order interpolation: all the pixels
within a quadtree cell encode the same value so have the same
color. The animation now shows information about both the field (the
color) and the adaptive quadtree grid (the sharp changes in color).

That's interesting but does not look very good. To use bilinear
interpolation instead, we need to call *output_ppm()* like this

~~~literatec
...
event images (t += 4./300.) {
  output_ppm (h, linear = true);
}
...
~~~

then recompile, rerun etc... The animation now looks good.

Are the results close to that obtained when using the regular
Cartesian grid? As for the convergence study above, we can use gnuplot
to find out

~~~bash
gnuplot> set xlabel 'Time'
gnuplot> set ylabel 'Depth'
gnuplot> plot 'log.256' using 1:2 with lines title 'min', \
              'log.256' using 1:3 with lines title 'max', \
              'log' using 1:2 with lines title 'min (adaptive)', \
              'log' using 1:3 with lines title 'max (adaptive)'
~~~

which gives

![Comparison between adaptive and Cartesian simulations](tuto/adaptive.png)

The results are close but not identical. Finding the right balance
between computing time and accuracy is an important part of setting up
numerical simulations.

## Displaying the grid

Although our animation now looks good, we lost the information about
grid size which was (partly) encoded in the first animation. Can we
generate an animation of the grid being used during the simulation?

One way to do this is to animate a field containing the *level* of the
quadtree cells rather than the depth *h*. Such a field does not exist
by default (even though we can access the value *level*, as well as
the coordinates $x$ and $y$, within [foreach](Basilisk C#iterators)
loops). We thus need to allocate a new field and fill it with the
values of *level*. We will then be able to generate the corresponding
animation using *output_ppm()* with this field.

We can do all this with the following code

~~~literatec
...
event images (t += 4./300.) {
  ...
  scalar l[];
  foreach()
    l[] = level;
  static FILE * fp = fopen ("grid.ppm", "w");
  output_ppm (l, fp, min = 0, max = 8);
}
...
~~~

We first [declare and allocate](Basilisk
C#declaration-allocation-and-deallocation) a new scalar field
*l*. This field is a local, automatic variable i.e. it will be
accessible only within the *images* event. The memory necessary to
store the field values will be automatically freed when the code
leaves this function.

We then loop over all the cells and set the values of *l* to the level
of the cell.

The next line declares a *static variable* i.e. a variable which is
kept in memory between calls to *images* (in contrast to automatic
variables). This variable is set only once, the first time *images* is
called, and points to a new file called *grid.ppm* in which we will
*write* ("w") things. This is done using the standard C function
[fopen()](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/fopen.3.html#1).

We can now call *output_ppm()* using *l* as the field to
display. Rather than writing images to the standard output, we use our
file pointer *fp*. We also set the minimum and maximum values of the
colorscale to avoid changes in color during the animation.

After recompiling and re-running, we can now do

~~~bash
animate grid.ppm
~~~

which gives an animation looking like

# Using Makefiles

By now, you are probably tired of typing

~~~bash
qcc -O2 -Wall bump.c -o bump -lm
./bump > out.ppm 2> log
~~~

You may also have made the mistake of doing only the second command
(running the code) and wondered why nothing changed in the ouput
(while you had edited *bump.c*).

[Makefiles](https://www.cs.colby.edu/maxwell/courses/tutorials/maketutor/) are a very useful tool
to automate such a *processing chain* (i.e. *log* and *out.ppm* both
depend on *bump* which in turns depends on *bump.c*).

Basilisk comes with a predefined Makefile which you can reuse for your
own computations. You just need to create a new text file called
*Makefile* (e.g. using the "File -> Visit New File" menu in emacs) and
type

~~~Makefile
CFLAGS += -O2
include $(BASILISK)/Makefile.defs
~~~

Save the file and type in the shell

~~~bash
rm bump
make bump.tst
~~~

This should produce something like

    .../Makefile.defs:9: Makefile.tests: No such file or directory
    .../Makefile.defs:93: Makefile.deps: No such file or directory
    Updating Makefile.deps
    sh /home/popinet/basilisk/src/tests.sh
    updating Makefile.tests
    .../Makefile.defs:93: Makefile.deps: No such file or directory
    .../qcc -MD -o bump.s.d bump.c
    Updating Makefile.deps
    qcc -O2 -Wall -o bump/bump bump.c -lm
    [bump.tst]

Do not worry about the first lines, they come from the initial setup
and will not be repeated when you invoke *make* again.

If you now do *ls* in the shell, you will see that a new directory
called *bump* has been created. This directory contains both the
executable (also called *bump*) and all the files produced when
running the program in this directory.

~~~bash
ls bump/*
~~~

The standard output has been redirected to *bump/out* and the standard
error to *bump/log*. As before, we can then run the animation using

~~~bash
animate bump/out
~~~

and display *bump/log* with gnuplot. Note that it is a good idea to
open a new terminal, *cd* to *bump* and leave gnuplot running in this
terminal. You will then be able to re-run the simulation using *make
bump.tst* in one terminal and display the results (while the
simulation is running) using *replot* in the other (gnuplot) terminal.

If you now redo

~~~bash
make bump.tst
~~~

you will get

    make: `bump.tst' is up to date.

The Makefile detected that nothing was modified which required
recompiling and/or rerunning the simulation.

The default Makefile in Basilisk does much more than this. Read
[*"Running and creating test cases (and
examples)"*](/wiki/src/test/README#running-and-creating-test-cases-and-examples)
if you want to know more.

# Using macros

I mentioned above that it would be a good idea to study the numerical
convergence of our example a bit more seriously. To do this, we need
to run the same code while varying the resolution. We could edit the
code by hand, changing each reference to resolution, recompile, rerun
etc... but that would be quite tedious and error-prone. A better way
to do this is to use standard *C macros* (which you should have
encountered already during your preparatory work).

If we look at our code, we see that the resolution or level of
refinement occur three times. Once as an argument to *output_ppm()*,
once as an argument to *adapt_wavelet()* and once as an argument of
*init_grid()* in the *main()* function.

Rather than changing these three values manually, we can write instead

~~~literatec
#include "saint-venant.h"

#define LEVEL 8
...
  output_ppm (l, fp, min = 0, max = LEVEL);
...
  adapt_wavelet ({h}, (double []){4e-3}, maxlevel = LEVEL);
...
  init_grid (1 << LEVEL);
...
~~~

That is, the macro *LEVEL* will be replaced by 8 in all three
places. The *<<* operator in C is a bit-shifting operation. All we
need to know here is that *1 << LEVEL* is identical to $2^{LEVEL}$. If
we want to change the resolution of the simulation, all we need to do
now is change the single value at the top of the file.

# Wrapping up

If you have followed the tutorial, your *bump.c* file should look like

~~~literatec
#include "saint-venant.h"

#define LEVEL 8

event init (t = 0) {
  double a = 1., b = 200.;
  foreach()
    h[] = 0.1 + a*exp(- b*(x*x + y*y));
}

event graphs (i++) {
  stats s = statsf (h);
  fprintf (stderr, "%g %g %g\n", t, s.min, s.max);
}

event images (t += 4./300.) {
  output_ppm (h, linear = true);

  scalar l[];
  foreach()
    l[] = level;
  static FILE * fp = fopen ("grid.ppm", "w");
  output_ppm (l, fp, min = 0, max = LEVEL);
}

event end (t = 4) {
  printf ("i = %d t = %g\n", i, t);
}

event adapt (i++) {
  adapt_wavelet ({h}, (double []){4e-3}, maxlevel = LEVEL);
}

int main() {
  origin (-0.5, -0.5);
  init_grid (1 << LEVEL);
  run();
}
~~~

# Further reading

I have made several references to the [Basilisk C]() manual. Now is a
good time to go through the manual and get more familiar with the
concepts, keywords and functions which are specific to Basilisk. Note
that you won't need all the features of the language if you just want
to use pre-defined solvers. The most important concepts and keywords
have been covered in this tutorial.

For more examples of applications, post-processing, graphs etc..., you
can also look at the

* [Examples](src/examples/README)
* [Test cases](src/test/README)

Note also that in these examples, as in the pieces of code above,
various keywords will be linked either to the documentation for
standard C functions or to the documentation of Basilisk keywords and
functions. You can learn a lot by following these links.

If you want to know what Basilisk can be used for, have a look at the
various [solvers](src/README#solvers) available. Again, if you just
want to use these pre-defined solvers, reading only the first few
sections should be sufficient (as we did for
[saint-venant.h](src/saint-venant.h)), but feel free to dig deeper if
you are interested. Note also that the "Usage" section at the end of
each page contains links to various applications of the solvers.
